Bajoo client
============

Official client for the cloud storage service Bajoo.

Bajoo is a service which lets you store your files in the cloud, and share them
into multiples devices and multiples users.
All files are encrypted client-side (before being sent to the bajoo servers)
with your secret phrase you're the only one to know.

This client is a graphic program aimed to interact with the bajoo service. It
can synchronize local folders with files stored in the Bajoo cloud.
